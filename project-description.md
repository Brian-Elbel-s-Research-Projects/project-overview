# Project overview

## Menu labeling
Obesity is a pervasive health problem in the United States, and poor diet is now the largest contributor to premature mortality in addition to causing cardiovascular disease, cancer and diabetes. 
Although a number of policies have been developed to address obesity by changing the environment in which food is purchased, research is needed to understand the impact these policies might have on food purchasing and obesity. 

Menu labeling is one such policy, requiring chain establishments to disclose the caloric value of menu items in text alongside each menu item so consumers can make more informed choices. 
These policies began in 2008 and were implemented nationwide under federal law in 2018. 

Prior studies of menu labeling are valuable yet lack a key feature needed to better understand the impact of labeling: large scale data on a vast number of purchases, which would allow for the estimation of small but meaningful cumulative effects (i.e., effects that produce population-level dietary improvements). 

We address this problem by using data provided from Taco Bell, a chain that has over 7,000 stores in the U.S., with over 5 billion transactions since 2007. 
The company has given us full access to receipt-level data, meaning we can identify the exact items (and calories) ordered for each purchase. These data and the staggered rollout of menu labeling policies across the nation from 2008 – 2018 will allow us to use a quasi-experimental design to demonstrate the impact of menu labeling on items and calories purchased in an incredibly well-powered and nuanced manner. 
We are unaware of any other examination of menu labeling that leverages such large-scale sales data, including at a national level.

Our specific aims are:
-	Aim 1: Determine the impact of calorie labeling on calories purchased by Taco Bell consumers. 
-	Aim 2: Determine the extent to which the impact of labeling differs by characteristics of the community, including a) demographics of the community (income and race/ethnicity), and b) urbanicity of the restaurant location.
-	Aim 3: Determine the extent to which the impact of labeling differs by characteristics of the purchase, including a) time of day, b) weekend or weekday, and c) drive through or ordered in the restaurant.

## Soda tax
This project will examine the impact of taxes on sugar sweetened beverages (SSBs) utilizing detailed sales data from one of the largest fast food retailers in the U.S. 
Taxes on SSBs are one of the most promising solutions to reduce population-wide consumption of these unhealthful beverages and, consequently, their contribution to obesity and the health challenges of cardiovascular disease, diabetes and cancer. 
SSB taxes have reduced purchasing and consumption of SSBs in settings such as supermarkets and other food stores across the seven U.S. cities that have implemented them. 
However, fast food restaurants are also a key source of SSBs -- more than a third of U.S. adults consume fast food on any given day, often including an SSB, and a single beverage at a fast food restaurant contains more than the recommended daily allowance of calories from added sugars in just one serving – and have not been studied. 

The central hypothesis is that SSB taxes will reduce purchase of SSBs at fast food restaurants, with a greater impact in lower-income census tracts, despite less than complete “pass-through” of the tax to the consumer by the fast food restaurants. 

Using detailed sales data and appropriate comparison groups from multiple communities, the study estimates the influence of SSB tax policies in a detailed and causal way for several years after taxes are implemented. 
The model is a difference-in-difference approach, taking advantage of the fact that some locations implemented taxes and (most) others did not. The study will look at sales in localities that are similar at baseline (before taxes) and determine how they diverge after a tax is implemented. 

This is the first study to rigorously examine SSB taxes across the U.S. in a longitudinal manner, including thousands of retail locations for Taco Bell and hundreds of millions of purchases.
The national scale of the data and multiple restaurants within each city that implemented a tax will allow estimation of whether effects of taxes differ by community income, critical to understanding health disparities and the regressive nature of SSB taxes. 

The specific aims are:
-	Aim 1: Determine the change in price paid in fast food restaurants as a result of SSB taxes (i.e., effective “pass-through”).
-	Aim 2: Determine the change in beverage calories purchased per customer order as a result of SSB taxes.
-	Aim 3: Determine how neighborhood characteristics, such as the income of the area in which a restaurant is located, influence both pass-through and beverage calories purchased in response to SSB taxes.

## COVID/SPHR
This research will examine how significant disruptions to children’s health, education and overall well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic created lasting influence on health, development and social trajectories through the lifecourse, and the risk for long-term health outcomes. 
Effects of the pandemic are unevenly distributed amongst children, particularly with respect to race/ethnicity and income, and are anticipated to both reflect and exacerbate the already wide health disparities in the United States. 
As vaccines continue to roll out, inequality in access to and take up of vaccinations could compound the disparate outcomes. 

New York City (NYC), where the 1 million public school children are majority Black or Hispanic (66%) and 74% are low-income, is an ideal place to situate this research. 
In the health domain, changes in diet and physical activity and missed healthcare may increase incidence and exacerbation of chronic diseases like obesity, asthma and diabetes. 

The pandemic generated stress and anxiety, with fewer of the usual mental health services supports available, posing risk for new and more severe health problems. 
Even after schools fully return to in-person learning, the educational consequences are expected to be protracted – including declines in academic achievement (test scores), increases in chronic absenteeism, repeating grades, or high school dropout. The research leverages the NYC Student Population Health Registry (SPHR), a uniquely inclusive, longitudinal database of all NYC public school students, created jointly by the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene and NYC Department of Education to examine these and other outcomes. 

SPHR links multiple municipal data sources at the child-level, allowing us to examine the influence of the COVID pandemic on myriad outcomes. 
The impact of variation in child-level, classroom-level and school-level vaccination rates will be important to understand, and it is expected that neighborhood and school characteristics (income, vaccination sites, emergency food resources, open space) will mitigate (or exacerbate) sustained impacts. 
Identifying sources of resilience, at either the individual or neighborhood level, is a public health priority. 

The specific aims are:
-	Aim 1: With a focus on disparities, determine health and education changes among children 2-4 years after pandemic onset compared to pre-pandemic using a new, comprehensive and powerful set of linked child-level administrative data.
-	Aim 2: Determine how child-level, school-level and neighborhood-level COVID vaccination rates influence the course of the COVID pandemic, with a focus on disparities.
-	Aim 3: Determine the role of neighborhood and school resources in exacerbating or mitigating health and educational disparities due to the COVID pandemic.

## Food/built environment
The last several years have witnessed growing interest in the potential contribution of the “built environment” to the epidemic increase in obesity rates in the United States. 
This includes both the large structural aspects of the neighborhood and physical characteristics of homes and schools at the very micro level (the interiors and associated grounds of these buildings).

The structural aspects of the neighborhood that surround the home and school includes urban design features such as streets and highways, land use mix, street connectivity, public transportation infrastructure (i.e., subway stations), park land, and recreational infrastructure, all of which could affect both physical activity and the accessibility of food and other resources. 
The physical characteristics of the home or school—including building size, the presence of elevators, stairs, spaces for physical activity, and related factors—could determine opportunities for physical activity and amount of activity needed to navigate the space. 
Thus far not established is how each of these factors contributes to childhood BMI in a distinct and interconnected way and/or how changes in such factors could influence obesity rates in a causal manner. 
This gap in knowledge is particularly troubling given the high cost of changing the built environment as well as the longevity of investments once made. 

Our research promises to provide insight critical to policymakers planning urban infrastructure investment. 
Particularly important to consider are disparities, and whether differences in the built environment could explain differences in obesity rates in key demographic groups, including income and race/ethnicity. 

We propose to combine New York City Department of Education FITNESSGRAM data, which includes BMI, school and residential locations, for all New York City public school children from 2005 onward, with detailed data on the built environment surrounding each child’s home and school as well as within their home and school. 
Then, we will use a variety of enhanced methodological techniques to estimate a less-biased, more causal relationship between the built environment and obesity. The methodological enhancements we utilize over past work are:
- A large, detailed dataset, including data on over 1 million NYC public school children.
- Examining longitudinally the same children over time, using both child, school and census tract level fixed effects, among other methods, to determine casualty. 
- Examining fine-grained differences in the built environment. For example, the relative influence of living within 500 feet of a park or other built environment resources
- Data on both the home and school built environment, both inside the building and in the neighborhood, modeled together.

With these enhancements, we will be able to provide improved estimates on the influence of the built environment on child BMI, substantially answering key health and policy-related questions.
