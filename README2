## Lab Mission and Impact

The Elbel Lab is dedicated to conducting rigorous research at the intersection of public health, economics, and policy. Our primary goal is to generate actionable evidence that can directly inform and evaluate public health interventions, with a particular focus on improving dietary choices, understanding the impact of food environments, and addressing health inequities. We strive to contribute to a healthier society through robust data analysis and dissemination of our findings to academic, policy, and public audiences.

**Note on Racial and Ethnic Disparities in COVID-19 Vaccine Uptake:**
Regarding the "Vaccine uptake - students" project, the published paper, "[COVID-19 vaccines for children: Racial and ethnic disparities in New York City](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211335523002486)," highlights significant disparities. For instance, in New York City, by March 2022, only **37.7%** of children aged 5-17 years had completed a primary vaccination series. Among these, **non-Hispanic Black** children had the lowest vaccination rates at **25.6%**, compared to **35.7%** for **Hispanic** children, **51.8%** for **non-Hispanic White** children, and **56.6%** for **non-Hispanic Asian** children. These disparities underscore the ongoing need to address equitable access and uptake of vaccines across different racial and ethnic groups.

## HPC Access and Usage

To resume an HPC session in which an interactive RStudio session is running, a new credentialing system has been implemented. In order to re-authenticate the session:

1.  Go to "My Interactive Sessions" tab.
2.  Click the long hexadecimal string for Session ID for your job.
3.  Find the file called `connection.yml` and open it. You'll find the password for your session in that file. Your username will be your regular Kerberos ID.
4.  Enter the username and password into RStudio. You'll be taken to a new page with a message. Once you get to that page, simply delete the last part of the URL in the address bar. It will say "AppUri?" or something similar.

*If you encounter any issues, please contact **[Relevant Contact Person/Email/Team]**.*
