## Lab Mission and Impact

The Elbel Lab is dedicated to conducting rigorous research at the intersection of public health, economics, and policy. Our primary goal is to generate actionable evidence that can directly inform and evaluate public health interventions, with a particular focus on improving dietary choices, understanding the impact of food environments, and addressing health inequities. We strive to contribute to a healthier society through robust data analysis and dissemination of our findings to academic, policy, and public audiences.
