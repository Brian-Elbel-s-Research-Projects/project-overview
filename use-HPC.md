## Using High Performing Cluster (HPC) at NYU Langone

Get started [here](http://bigpurple-ws.nyumc.org/wiki/index.php/BigPurple_HPC_Cluster). 

### Apply for an account
You would need to apply to get an account on HPC, and request access to:
- the team's shared lab space at gpfs/data/elbellab
- database access: tacobell and tacobell2

Write to <hpc_admins@nyumc.org> and apply for an account with the email template below. 
Once you have an account, write to Brian and request access to the team's shared lab space and databases (as outlined above).
When you get the approval, forward it to the HPC admins, and request access.

##### Email template for account application
1.	The new user’s full name
2.	The new user’s MCIT-assigned Kerberos ID (usually the user’s initials or part of the user’s name followed by a number of digits)
3.	The new user’s email address (to receive important announcements via the BigPurple-HPCF mailing list)
4.	The department/center of the new user: **department of population health**
5.	Their division/section within the department: **section on health choice, policy and evaluation**
6.	The name of the new user’s PI: **Dr. Brain Elbel**
7.	The title of the project for which BigPurple-HPC resources are to be used: **using national sales data to understand the influence of menu labeling policy**
8.	A description of the research conducted by the new user (one short paragraph): **our research utilizes national sales data at a receipt level from a large fast food restaurant chain. We plan to use this data to assess whether consumers changed their orders and purchases in response to the menu labeling mandate, which requires fast food restaurant chains to label their menu board with calorie information.**
9.	A description of the BigPurple-HPC needs such as data storage, compute power, data transfers, etc. (one short paragraph): **I need a standard personal account to test my scripts, as well as access to the lab space under Dr. Elbel at gpfs/data/elbellab. I also need access to the two databases named tacobell and tacobell2.**

### Access tacobell database
Most projects involving menu labeling research will use the ```tacobell``` database.
To use the database, log into your HPC account.
