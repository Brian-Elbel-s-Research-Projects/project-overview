# Elbel Lab Research Projects

A comprehensive overview of current and past research initiatives from the Elbel Lab, focusing on public health interventions related to nutrition, food environments, and health disparities. Our work aims to provide evidence-based insights to inform policy and improve community health outcomes.

## Lab Mission and Impact

The Elbel Lab is dedicated to conducting rigorous research at the intersection of public health, economics, and policy. Our primary goal is to generate actionable evidence that can directly inform and evaluate public health interventions, with a particular focus on improving dietary choices, understanding the impact of food environments, and addressing health inequities. We strive to contribute to a healthier society through robust data analysis and dissemination of our findings to academic, policy, and public audiences.

## HPC Access and Usage

This section provides crucial administrative notes for accessing and resuming sessions on our High-Performance Computing (HPC) cluster. Please follow these steps carefully to re-authenticate your RStudio sessions. For any technical issues beyond these instructions, please reach out to **[Designated HPC Support Person/Team Contact Info, e.g., hpc-support@example.edu]**.

To resume an HPC session in which an interactive RStudio session is running, a new credentialing system has been implemented. In order to re-authenticate the session:

1.  Go to "My Interactive Sessions" tab.
2.  Click the long hexadecimal string for Session ID for your job.
3.  Find the file called `connection.yml` and open it. You'll find the password for your session in that file. Your username will be your regular Kerberos ID.
4.  Enter the username and password into RStudio. You'll be taken to a new page with a message. Once you get to that page, simply delete the last part of the URL in the address bar. It will say "AppUri?" or something similar.

## Project Management & Collaboration

Effective project management is key to our research efficiency. We leverage GitHub's Projects feature to track tasks, manage workflows, and collaborate across various initiatives.

### Main Project Board
Emil's primary project board for the lab's ongoing work and overall task management can be found here:
**[Elbel Lab Projects Dashboard](https://github.com/orgs/Brian-Elbel-s-Research-Projects/projects/8/views/1)**

This board provides an overview of current tasks, their status, assigned members, and allows us to visualize our progress.

### Creating Your Own Project Board
Individual projects or sub-teams may benefit from their own dedicated project boards for more granular task management. Here's how to create one within our GitHub organization:

1.  **Navigate to Projects:** From the main GitHub page for the `Brian-Elbel-s-Research-Projects` organization, click on the "Projects" tab.
2.  **New Project:** Click the "New project" button.
3.  **Choose a Template (Optional):** You can start with a blank board or choose a template (e.g., "Basic kanban," "Automated kanban"). For simplicity and flexibility, starting with a blank board is often recommended.
4.  **Name Your Project:** Give your project a clear, descriptive name (e.g., "Menu Labeling Paper 2 Analysis Plan").
5.  **Visibility:** Ensure the visibility is set appropriately (e.g., "Private" for internal-only, or "Public" if it aligns with open science practices for that project).
6.  **Create:** Click "Create project".
7.  **Add Fields and Views:** Once created, you can customize your project by adding fields (e.g., Status, Priority, Assignee, Iteration) and creating different views (Table, Board, Roadmap) to suit your workflow.
8.  **Link to Repositories (Optional but Recommended):** You can link specific repositories to your project, allowing you to easily track issues and pull requests from those repos directly on your board.

Remember to regularly update your project board to keep it a useful tool for tracking progress and identifying blockers.
